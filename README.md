# Node TS (TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + Webpack + Husky Hooks)

## Overview

Node TS provides a quick and efficient way to generate a fully configured Node.js backend application.  
It includes **TypeScript**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **Webpack**, and **Husky** (pre-commit hook) out of the box, enabling developers to start with a clean, structured, and production-ready setup.  
This eliminates the need for repetitive setup tasks and ensures consistent code quality across teams.

## Features

- **Predefined folder structure** following best practices from experienced Node.js developers.
- **TypeScript** with built-in path alias support for cleaner imports.
- **ESLint** configured to enforce high-quality coding standards and prevent unwanted code patterns.
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting.
- **Webpack** for optimized builds (introduced in v1.2.0).
- **Husky** pre-commit hook preconfigured to run lint checks before committing code.
- **Hot reloading** via Nodemon for faster development feedback loops.
- **Dockerfile** included for containerization support.
- Fully **customizable** configuration.
